# This project is no longer active

I deeply appreciated the BrowserBase project and the work its developers put into it. When I first started working on this project, I didn’t fully understand or look into the licensing terms as thoroughly as I do now. Over time, I’ve come to better understand the importance of these aspects, and this experience has been a significant learning opportunity for me.

While my project was intended as a continuation of their work, I now recognize the importance of respecting the original developers’ contributions and the legal nuances involved. Out of respect for their efforts, I have decided to take the project down. Moving forward, I will focus on creating something entirely my own, built from the ground up. This decision reflects my commitment to avoiding any potential misunderstandings or conflicts. To honor the developers, I have removed the previous files and replaced them with this branch and README to explain my reasoning.

+ I plan to work on projects that are either explicitly open-source with clear licensing or entirely original creations of my own. This approach ensures I steer clear of any legal or ethical uncertainties.

+ For clarity, my intention was never to claim the original project as my own. I explicitly stated in my repository that my efforts were a continuation of the project. However, with a better understanding of the situation now, I feel it is important to take this step.

To the developers of the original project, I sincerely apologize for any distress my actions may have caused or if they appeared disrespectful in any way. I have the utmost respect for your work and contributions. My only goal was to continue the project and support its development. I deeply regret any missteps and have grown significantly from this experience. Thank you for your understanding.
