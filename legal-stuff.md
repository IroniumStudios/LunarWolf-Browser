This project, "browser-base", and its attached electron-extensions as well as and not limited to the RPC package are licensed under the GPL License. The original creator of "browser-base" alongside the electron-extensions and RPC package is ["Eryk Rakowski <sentialx@gmail.com>"].

i wanted to add this license in here sso that Eryk knows im not trying to rip off his code and any other assets that he rightfully owns.

now any other code iv written is license free, which means i dont mined anyone using it as long as you give credit in your project that some of ytour code came from the Browser-Base-Updated repository

NOTE: this legal-stuff.md file will be placed in all products iv modified from Eryk's original work, so that its clear that im not trying to take credit for his hard work, and that im just trying to extend and improve the browser-base project for the community.
